    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am software developer and I like building products. A few years ago I learned to code by myself and now I am working on how to build my first product. I believe in a decentralized working way (remote working), learning by doing (everything is on the Internet!!) and doing things simple (you know, keep simple stupid).</p>

    <p>When I am not doing this, you can find me checking flights for my next destination, enjoying gastronomy of the place where I am or taking photos somewhere.</p>

    <h2>Contact me</h2>
