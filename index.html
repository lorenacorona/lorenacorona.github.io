      <h1>Hi! I am software developer and I like building products</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <p>A few years ago I learned to code by myself and now I am working on how to build my first product. I believe in a decentralized working way (remote working), learning by doing (everything is on the Internet!) and doing things simple (you know, keep simple stupid).</p>

    <p>When I am not doing this, you can find me checking flights for my
      <a class="link" href="/travel">next destination</a>, enjoying <a class="link" href="https://es.foursquare.com/_albertogallego" target="_blank">gastronomy</a> of the place where I am or <a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/_albertogallego/" target="_blank">taking photos</a> somewhere.</p>

    <h2>I help people building their software products</h2>
    <p>
      Do you have an idea? Do you want to make it real? I am here to help you. Together we can make your idea tangible. I will guide you through all the process: defining which are gonna be the features, helping you making the best decision in each situation and developing your product. Always being honest and transparent.
