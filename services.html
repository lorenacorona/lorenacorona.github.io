      <h1>Do you have an idea and you want to build your software product?</h1>

    <p>
      Want to make real your product idea? Let's build your Minimum Viable Product. Together we'll set a roadmap with the necessary features to make real your idea in a few weeks.

      In the interest of saving us all some time, here are some <strong>good reasons to not get in touch with me</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>You want a personal website or blog.</strong> I just work with web apps, so if you are looking for someone to develop your personal website/blog, I am not your man.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You want to use a specific technology or tool.</strong> I will use JavaScript and Ruby on Rails because it's the best way for me to give your more valuable product.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You want work done for free.</strong> If you send me an email with a small and specific question, I will help you. But I won't help you if you want a development for free, some code reviews...etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      <h2>How we can collaborate</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      If youâ€™re still with me, we can start this way:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Write me and share with me your challenge.</strong> Try to be specific explaining me your project idea.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We'll set a roadmap with deadlines.</strong> We are gonna work together to set the bunch of features for your MVP.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>It's time to start coding!</strong> I will start developing your product, showing my progress in weekly reviews.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Launch your product.</strong> I will leave you everything prepare for your launch day. Your idea now is real!
        </li>
      </ol>
