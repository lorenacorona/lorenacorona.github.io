<h1 class="title">Hello! I'm Lorena.</h1>
<p>My life is guided by two simple but powerful principles:</p>
<p>💪 Work hard. I give my best to everything I do. Otherwise, it wouldn’t make sense. Who wants to waste his life doing insignificant stuff? This also applies to my self-improvement. So, as an avid learner, I am always ready to learn something new. UX/UI, project management, a new marketing trend... or even a new dance move. Anything that catches my eye and/or helps me become a better, happier version of myself.</p>

<p>🌍 Try to make a difference. I firmly believe in stepping outside the norm. So, besides working on marketing helping good companies to grow, I'm also trying to make a difference through entrepreneurship and creativity. As Gloria Steinem once said, "the future depends entirely on what each of us does every day".</p>

<p>My latest project? <a class="link-body" href="https://eticaly.com/">Eticaly</a>, the first site to find fashion brands that fit your values without compromising on style. Check it out and tell me what you think ;)</p>
