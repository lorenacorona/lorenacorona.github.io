          Iâ€™ve never believed in the current education system, so I have learned to code by myself, without universities. After a few years of experience, now it's the moment to build my own online products and share with the world what I am learning, in case someone is interested. I believe in working in a decentralized way, learning by doing and doing things simple. That's me.
