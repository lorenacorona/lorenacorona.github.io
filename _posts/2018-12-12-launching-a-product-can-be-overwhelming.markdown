<p class="post-body">When it comes to a new business launch, my motto has always been go big or go home. I think the time and effort behind big projects is worth celebrating, don’t you? Not only are new launches a great opportunity to get your audience excited about your business, but they can also expand your reach. And even more importantly, big launches can result in big profits. The problem? There is a lot of things that can be done that sometimes I find it so overwhelming I can ever decide where to start. And I just get stuck.</p>


<p class="post-body">So today I thought about sharing some random ideas that can be implemented before the launch, the big day and after it. Because whether you take away one idea from this post or try to implement them all, you’ll be able to create a little more excitement around your new business launch. And the more excitement you can generate around your business, the greater chance you have of expanding your audience, engaging with your followers, and increasing your sales. What I learned is, in the end, every little thing helps.</p>

<p class= "post-subtitle">START A COUNTDOWN</p>
<p class="post-body">Countdowns serve two purposes: they act as a reminder to your audience and they build anticipation. I can think of several brands and businesses whose countdown for their new website or product kept me on the edge of my seat and encouraged me to tune in on the day and hour of the launch. But maybe I’m a little freak.</p>

<p class="post-body">You can start a countdown within your blog posts, in your blog sidebar, on your homepage, and/or across your social media accounts.</p>

<p class="post-subtitle">PEOPLE LOVE FREE STUFF</p>
<p class="post-body">Giveaways are a great way to get your audience involved with your launch through shares and feedback. People love free stuff. So if you are building some kind of tool, my advice is: give away a few plans for free. This way you’ll have the ability to expand your reach by asking them to share about it on social media.</p>

<p class="post-body">It might be a good idea to start a giveaway a week or two before your launch. This way you’ll have time to grow your audience before you actually launch it. I found a tool named <a class="link-body" href="https://www.rafflecopter.com/?utm_source=lorenacorona&utm_medium=blog">Rafflecopter</a> where you can easily set up a giveaway in seconds. Really.</p>

<p class="post-body">Another thing I really think that works are referrals. Referral marketing is the secret weapon behind the growth of some of the big-name brands today. Word of mouth is the best form of advertising, but good marketers and entrepreneurs don’t leave things to chance. With referral marketing, you can deliberately encourage your customers to tell their friends about you. The best tool I found for this is <a class="link-body" href="https://viral-loops.com/?utm_source=lorenacorona&utm_medium=blog">Viral Loops</a>. Plus, they offer campaign templates inspired by kick-ass companies like Dropbox, Airbnb or MailChimp.</p>

<p class= "post-subtitle">BUILD A LANDING PAGE. SERIOUSLY</p>
<p class="post-body">Landing pages can be really helpful for building anticipation while you’re making final adjustments and getting all things done. But most importantly they are a huge boost in motivation.</p>

<p class="post-body">They can also give your audience a sneak peek of what’s to come and point them to your social media accounts and newsletter sign-up. Actually, you can start recollecting emails from people who pre-register for your product and keep them updated.</p>

<p class= "post-subtitle">SHARE SNEAK PEEKS AND TEASERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA</p>
<p class="post-body">We all love behind-the-scenes images and sneak peeks. It’s hard to admit, but we all love to gossip. Invite your audience inside your new launch by sharing photos and teasers on your blog and social media accounts. Not only does this create anticipation, but it creates more engagement and makes your business more personable. Keep it human.</p>

<p class= "post-subtitle">ENCOURAGE OTHERS IN YOUR INDUSTRY TO SHARE ABOUT YOUR LAUNCH</p>
<p class="post-body">If you’re getting ready to launch your new project, consider talking to experts and people with influence within your industry. If you’re launching a new tool, offer free access in return of a mention if they feel like it. But don’t push. Nobody likes annoying people.</p>

<p class="post-body">It’s important to cultivate a relationship with bloggers and the media in your field. If you can get top bloggers interested, the idea could spread like wildfire.</p>

<p class= "post-subtitle">BLOG ABOUT IT</p>
<p class="post-body">Take advantage of your blog (or platforms like <a class="link-body" href="https://medium.com/?utm_source=lorenacorona&utm_medium=blog">Medium</a>) to generate excitement before, during, and after a launch. Share about the process, explain the benefits of your product, and plant seeds about the launch long before you release more details. You could even create a blog series around it. You can really get creative on this one.</p>

<p class= "post-subtitle">DON’T GIVE AWAY ALL THE DETAILS. KEEP SOMETHING FOR THE LAUNCH</p>
<p class="post-body">Instead of giving away all of the details before launch day, build anticipation by creating some suspense around your new product. Think through ways that you can create hype by holding out until launch day.</p>

<p class= "post-subtitle">STAY ACTIVE ON FORUMS LIKE QUORA FOR TOPICS RELATED TO YOUR PRODUCT</p>
<p class="post-body">Quora is a great place to see what popular questions people are answering in your industry. Try to stay active and making a name by answering them and be proactive.</p>

<p class= "post-subtitle">GET INVOLVED IN ONLINE GROUPS</p>
<p class="post-body">Facebook groups, LinkedIn groups and Slack communities are a good way to stay in touch with people in your industry that may be interested in your new project.</p>

<p class= "post-subtitle">GIVE A CHANCE TO THE PRESS</p>
<p class="post-body">You can’t forget writing a good press release. You just need one page of content that media can use directly for a story on your product. Write it in the third person and try to go straight to the point: talk about the advantages of your product and the team behind it.</p>

<p class="post-body">I know. It’s a lot of work to prepare the launch of a new product… As if building the product itself was not enough. But don’t panic and just write down the things you want to do (and please, be realistic!).</p>
