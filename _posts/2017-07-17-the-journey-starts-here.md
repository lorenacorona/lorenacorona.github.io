Hi, my name is Alberto and I have to tell you something. Like me, I am sure you were thinking about a new idea, a new project or a new adventure to pursue. But you live in your comfort zone, leaving things for another day. I understand you, I am like you. I spent more or less 3 years until I sayed "Today is the day to open this blog, today is the day to put myself out of the comfort zone".

I want to live and believe in myself every day: I want to commit myself to no more procrastination (at least not too much, you know). I want to live in a MVP lifestyle, first making things work, and then trying to perfect them.

### What is this blog about?

* Is about **learning by doing**.
* Is about **keeping things simple** in all the aspects of your life.
* Is about my thoughts, my learnings about **products building, launching and growing**.
* Is about **remote working** and trying to **balance family/friends/business**.

### What is not this blog about?

* Is not about **code**, it's about software problems solutions.
* Is not about **magic solutions**, just hard work.
* Is not about **perfection**, just a way to try new things and see what happens.

This journey starts, hope you like it! In the following days, I will write another post :)

Bests,<br/>
