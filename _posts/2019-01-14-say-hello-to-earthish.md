Over the past few months I've been working on creating [Earthish](https://earthish.co). The truth is that the idea came up very naturally, as I was thinking about the best way to do my bit for the world. But what always ends up happening is that I feel overwhelmed by the amount of work left to do that I don't even know where to start. Then I thought: why not start educating myself? And it made sense: this is where the idea of Earthish comes in.

I wanted to build a space where entrepreneurs, creatives and anyone interested in a better world could understand today’s social problems and act accordingly. I’ve always loved to volunteer (in many different causes) but, over the years, I’ve realized that making an impact on society doesn’t come from volunteering one summer every three years. Actually, we have all heard of certain “volunteer abroad programs” where the volunteer ends up getting more out of it than the community he/she is supposed to be helping.

I want to learn, and I want to help you do it as well. Okay, so we want to be involved in these causes and make an impact. But, firstly, do we really understand what’s going on? Do we understand the issue on a global level? Maybe we are aware of the short-term consequences, but what about the long-term or less obvious? Is there any organization already doing the work? And a long etcetera. So I want to give you an opportunity to contribute by educating yourself first. The more educated we are, the more capable of making a real difference.

Earthish is nothing else than a monthly reminder of the things that you, as a citizen, can do to change the world. In the form of an email, I'll discuss a different social issue each month and send you ideas and practical steps to make an impact on Earth. Let us be honest: there’s a lot of work to do, there is much room for improvement, and there are plenty of things to do. So let’s dig deeper into it. We are all students, not experts, and the goal is that we can grow together.

The goal is simple: to remind you that you can make an impact and you don't have to give your life to it. Earthish has been created to offer you a much-needed distraction, a reminder that you can also leave your mark on the world. If you're curious and if you're conscious and conscientious about your actions... Earthish is your place.
