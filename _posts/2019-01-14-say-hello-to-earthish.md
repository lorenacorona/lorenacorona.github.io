Over the past few months I've been working on creating [Earthish](https://earthish.co). [As I explained before](/articles/life-journal-i-change), I've been experiencing kind of an "identity crisis" which made me shut myself away and focus on getting to know me better. So recently I have reached the conclusion that what really makes me happy is helping make the world a better place. In any way. And this is where the idea of Earthish comes in. Well, let's dig deeper into it.

I wanted to build a space where entrepreneurs, creatives and anyone interested in a better world could understand today's social problems and act accordingly. I've always loved to volunteer (in many different causes) but, over the years, I've realized that making an impact on society doesn't come from volunteering one summer every three years. Actually, we have all heard of certain "volunteer abroad programs" where the volunteer ends up getting more out of it than the community he/she is supposed to be helping.

I want to learn, and I want to help you do it as well. Okay, so we want to be involved in these causes and make an impact. But, firstly, do we really understand what's going on? Do we understand the issue on a global level? Maybe we are aware of the short-term consequences, but what about the long-term or less obvious? Is there any organization already doing the work? And a long etcetera. So I want to give you an opportunity to contribute by educating yourself first. The more educated we are, the more capable of making a real difference.

Let us be honest: there's a lot of work to do. And when there is so much to do, it is difficult to decide even where to start. That's why I want us to talk about a different issue every month. There is much room for improvement, and there are plenty of things to do. So let's dig deeper into it. We are all students, not experts, and the goal is that we can grow together.

You can make an impact. And you don't have to give your life to it. You can pursue your professional and personal success while giving your best to also make a difference on Earth. Earthish has been created to offer you a much-needed distraction, a reminder that while on your way to success you can also leave your mark on the world. If you're curious, if you're conscious and conscientious about your actions, if you want to go further... Earthish is your place.

That's it. You can join me by [subscribing to the monthly newsletter here](https://earthish.co). Also, if you want to give me some feedback please feel free to contact me directly by email, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lorenacoronam), or wherever you prefer.
