This year has been the first one that I've really found the time to stop and think about my goals. I know, after 23 years... It was about time. The problem is we're already at the end of November and... I'm not even close to reaching any of them.

I know this is only my fault. I've been so anxious and stressed out for too long that I haven't been able to do almost anything meaningful at all. But finally, I've realized if I don't get to the root of the problem, everything will remain the same. And, actually, I'm tired of being my biggest enemy. I now understand that if you always do what you've always done, you'll always get what you've always got. Words of wisdom. So if there's one thing I know for sure, it's that I want to change my life. Really. I need it. I've been self-sabotaged for too long now.

I know this happens to a lot of people. We know deep down what we need to do to get what we want. But there's an inner voice that always manages to make the perfect excuse to convince us not to do it. How the hell?!

I've now reached the point at which I've become so tired of myself for being like this that I thought sharing my intentions with the rest of the world would make me be under pressure to really get to the bottom of it. And this time for good.

I know this "change my life" thing may sound a bit dramatic, but I can't help it, I was born a drama queen. I need a drastic change, I'm looking forward to being in a whole new chapter of my life. And if I don't get my sh*t together, it will never happen. In the end, it's all on me.

So I've decided to start writing this journal to end this year with the best taste in the mouth. And as small steps lead to the biggest changes, in these posts I will share with you little things that I want to change to make a difference. My goal is not to achieve all my 2018 goals in just one month (because it is not realistic at all), but if this journal brings with it a shift in mentality, I'll be more than satisfied.
